# Welcome to API Architecture repo

## This repository is an example of my architectural thinking about creating such API

I have to admit, that I'm pretty new in considerations about architecture, but I'm really into it!

I've made this project to show how I would build such project, using seperation of concerns, DRY principle, clean-coding and Object Oriented Paradigm.

Also, you can find descriptions of my flow of thinking in many cases.

I know it's not perfect, I'm learning a lot about it and immadietaly try to implement anything I learn.

### How to start it?

Firstable, run:

```
git init \
git clone 'https://github.com/DasminX/api-architecture.git' \
cd api-architecture
```

### Now there are two paths

1. Using docker:

    Create an image
    `npm run docker:build-image`

    Run the container
    `npm run docker:start-container`

2. On local machine:

    Install packages
    `npm i`

    Run development script
    `npm run start:dev`

When successfully running, you can make an API calls to localhost:3000!

STILL IN PROGRESS!!! MORE SOON.
