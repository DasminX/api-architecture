# Welcome to API Architecture repo

## This repository is an example of my architectural thinking about creating such API

I have to admit, that I'm pretty new in considerations about architecture, but I'm really into it!

I've made this project to show how I would build such project, using seperation of concerns, DRY principle, clean-coding and Object Oriented Paradigm.

Also, you can find descriptions of my flow of thinking in many cases.

I know it's not perfect, I'm learning a lot about it and immadietaly try to implement anything I learn.

More soon.
